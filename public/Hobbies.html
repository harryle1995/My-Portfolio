    <h1>This is my list of hobbies</h1>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Coding
            <br>I have just started coding for less than a week, but I already felt excited about it. I love the feelings of combining logic and creativity while solving problems and building websites.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Badminton
            <br>I love fast sport, and suprisingly, badminton is known to be the fastest sport existing so far. A professional player can create a speed of upto 400km/h on the shuttlecocks with their smashes. Playing fast sport helps me train focusing ability, and calm thinking.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Movies
            <br>The lastest form of art on the Earth, and also the most colorful. Through cinematography, people can paint a story in a way that words can't tell. My top 3 movies are: Interstellar, 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Reading
            <br>I used to read a lot of novels when I was a teen, but recently, I mostly read about documents, speeches, or analyses, something that are more academic.
